This competition is aimed at predicting age & four other assessment scores to guage normalcy of brain functioning,
from followin feautres,  
- 3D functional spatial maps from resting-state functional-MRI(fMRI)
- static functional network connectivity (FNC) matrices  
- source based morphometry (SBM) loading values from structural-MRI(sMRI)  

sMRI is a technique for examining the anatomy and pathology of the brain, while fMRI is used to examine brain activity.
