This competition is aimed at predicting age & four other assessment scores that will help to capture useful patient-level characteristics in clinical settings, for individualized treatment trajectory.  

The following data is provided to facilitate useful analytics,  
- 3D functional spatial maps from resting-state functional-MRI(fMRI)    ----->functional  
- static functional connectivity  network connectivity (FNC) matrices                 ----->connectivity   
- source based morphometry (SBM) loading values from structural-MRI(sMRI)---->structural  

sMRI is a technique for examining the anatomy and pathology of the brain, while fMRI is used to examine brain activity. 
[functional connectivity] (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/functional-connectivity)is the presence of statistical dependencies between two sets of neurophysiological data.
