The channels are classified broadly into 2 categories depending on whether they have a low probability of opening(low conductance) or a high probability of opening(high conductance):-  
1.Batch1 and Batch2 represent low-probability channels: binary classification
2.Other Batches represnet high-probabaility channels: multi-class classification---->Model2  

### Model1: DecisionTree classifying a channel as either open or closed.
### Model2:
