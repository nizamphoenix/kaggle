This Kaggle competition stands out from other challenges, in that it was aimed at pushing the frontiers of creative machine intelligence --technically called generative modelling-- by applying innovative machine learning techniques and other image processing hacks to generating new images of dogs. Only this time thereâ€™s no ground truth data to predict -- classifying the images--, finally, we submit the generated images and be scored based on how well those images are classified as dogs from pre-trained neural networks.  

The class of algorithms used to produce novelty from history(data)are called *generative models*, Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are one among them. GANs can generate data(images) that have never existed before by pitting two neural networks against one another (adversarial) where the system can start with minimal instructions and produce novel outcomes (generative).  

GANs can be considered as artists that create novelty from trite stuff by iteratively learning to do well on the task. It is pretty much similar to how humans become creative by working on a job and receiving feedback from a mentor to rectify their understanding and later improving the art until novelty is obtained.

Generative methods (in particular, GANs) are used in various places for data augmentation. Their potential is vast: they can learn to mimic any distribution of data across any domain, from photographs to drawings to music and prose. If successful, it will not only push the frontiers of generative image creation, but also enable to create more experiments across a variety of domains in the future.
