Use your training skills to create images, rather than identify them. You’ll be using GANs, which are at the creative frontier of machine learning. 

This kaggle competition stands out from other competitons, in that it is aimed at pushing the frontier of creative machine learning by developing techniques for generating novel images of dogs rather than identifying ,or classifying the images of dogs, such class of algorithms are called Generative adversarial networks (GANs)s, a class of machine learning systems that can generate data(images) that has never existed before-- subset of generative models.  

GANs can be considered as artists that create novel stuff from trite stuff by iteratively learning to do well on the task.

In this competition, you’ll be training generative models to create images of dogs. Only this time… there’s no ground truth data for you to predict. Here, you’ll submit the images and be scored based on how well those images are classified as dogs from pre-trained neural networks.

Generative methods (in particular, GANs) are currently used in various places on Kaggle for data augmentation. Their potential is vast; they can learn to mimic any distribution of data across any domain: photographs, drawings, music, and prose. If successful, it will push the frontiers of generative image creation, but also enable to create more experiments across a variety of domains in the future.
