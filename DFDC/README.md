Deepfake is a portmanteau of "deep learning" and "fake"; it is a bunch of fake videos produced by altering real videos with modern artificial intelligence tools like deep learning, specifically GANs.  Usually, the identity of an individual in a Deepfake video is swapped with someone else's.  

Such content modification technologies may affect the quality of public discourse and the safeguarding of human rightsâ€”especially given that deepfake may be used maliciously as a source of misinformation, manipulation, harassment, and persuasion.  
Identifying such manipulated media was the objective of this competition, which was hosted by Facebook.

### Approach:-
Google's Blazeface was used to perform face extraction, and Xception net was used to accomplish the task objective. Please check my work [here](https://github.com/nizamphoenix/kaggle/blob/master/DFDC/Fa%7Bc%2Ck%7De%20detector.ipynb).
