Deepfake is a portmanteau of "deep learning" and "fake", it is a bunch of fake videos produced by altering true videos with modern artificial intelligence tools like deep learning, specifically GANs.  Usually the identity of an individual in a deepfake video is replaced with someone else's.  
Such content modification technologies may affect the quality of public discourse and the safeguarding of human rights—especially given that deepfakes may be used maliciously as a source of misinformation, manipulation, harassment, and persuasion.  
Identifying such manipulated media was the objective of this competition, hosted by Facebook.
