Deepfake is a portmanteau of "deep learning" and "fake", it is a bunch of fake videos produced by altering true videos with modern artificial intelligence tools like deep learning, specifically GANs.  Usually the identity of an individual in a deepfake video is replaced with someone else's.  
Such content modification technologies may affect the quality of public discourse and the safeguarding of human rightsâ€”especially given that deepfakes may be used maliciously as a source of misinformation, manipulation, harassment, and persuasion.  
Identifying such manipulated media was the objective of this competition, hosted by Facebook.
